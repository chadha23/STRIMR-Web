# Essential Files Guide

## ✅ ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY (Only 1 file!)

**`index-simple.html`** - This is your complete website!
- Contains everything: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Open this file to see your website
- This is all you need to work with!

## 📚 DOCUMENTATION FILES (Helpful but not required)

These are guides to help you understand and modify the template:

### Highly Recommended:
- **`README.md`** - Main overview and quick start
- **`BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md`** - What your PHP backend needs to provide

### Optional (Nice to have):
- `SIMPLE_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` - How to modify the template
- `README-SIMPLE.md` - More details about the simple version
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Development workflow (mostly for React version)
- `FRONTEND_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` - Template guide (for React version)
- `HOW_TO_VIEW.md` - How to view (for React version)

## 🗑️ What You Can Delete

If you want to keep it minimal, you can delete:
- All the `.md` files except `README.md` and `BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- You'll still have a fully working website!

## 📁 Minimal Setup (Recommended)

Keep only:
```
HELL/
├── index-simple.html         ⭐ Your website (REQUIRED)
├── README.md                 (Helpful guide)
└── BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md   (Shows what PHP needs)
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Minimum needed:** Just `index-simple.html`!

Everything else is documentation to help you understand and modify it.
